["index.html", "Probation review report Introduction", " Probation review report Alessandro Gasparini 2017-08-03 Introduction This report presents the work I have done during my first year as a PhD student at the Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester, under the supervision of Dr. Michael Crowther and Prof. Keith Abrams. I will begin by briefly introducing the topic of survival analysis in Chapter 1. Second, I will introduce survival models with random effects (e.g. frailties, in the simplest form) and joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data in Chapters 2 and 3, respectively. Computational challenges that survival models with random effects and joint models pose are presented in Chapter 4. Third, I will present the results of two simulation studies in Chapters 5 and 6; the first simulation study investigates the accuracy of quadrature methods when approximating analytically intractable terms, while the second simulation study investigates the impact of model misspecification in survival models with shared frailty terms. Fourth, I will introduce an interactive tool I have been developing to aid the dissemination of results from simulation studies in Chapter 7. Then, I will introduce the problem of informative visiting process in clinical research using healthcare consumption data in Chapter 8, and how we aim to evaluate and compare the different approaches that have been proposed and utilised in literature to tackle such problem in Chapter 9. Finally, I will briefly summarise the training and personal development activities I have participated to during the first year of my PhD in Chapter 10.

["sa.html", "1 Introduction to survival analysis", " 1 Introduction to survival analysis Survival analysis is a branch of statistics in which the main outcome consists in the time until the occurrence of a given event. Time could be years, months, weeks, or any amount of calendar time or even age time; event could be death, disease occurrence or relapse, or any other experience of interest. Survival analysis is also known as reliability theory in engineering, duration analysis in economics, and event history analysis in sociology. A broad overview of survival analysis is given in Kalbfleisch and Prentice (2011) and in Kleinbaum and Klein (2012). Some examples of time to event data are: disease remission in leukemia patients. In this study, leukemia patients are followed over several weeks to study how long they stay in remission status; heart disease occurrence. In this study, healthy subjects are followed over several years until occurrence of heart disease, or end of the study; renal failure. In this study, individuals with kidney disease are followed until renal failure, or end of the study; reliability of complex technical installations. For instance, studies assessing failure rates of components such as bulbs and valves. In this Chapter I will define survival data and its peculiarities in Section 1.1 and 1.2. Terminology and notation used throughout this report will be introduced in Section 1.3. I will introduce common non-parametric and parametric methods in survival analysis in Sections 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6. I will introduce the widely used semi-parametric Cox model in Section 1.7. Finally, I will provide a brief overview of modern, advanced statistical methods in survival analysis in Section 1.8. References "],
["sa-survdata.html", "1.1 Survival data", " 1.1 Survival data Survival data generally consists - as previously mentioned - in an event of interest and time until its occurrence. In the leukemia remission example, time to event would be how many weeks it takes before a given patient experiences disease relapse and the event would be whether the individual relapsed or not before the end of the study. Nevertheless, in certain situations we may have some information about the survival time but the actual survival time may be unknown. This problem is know as censoring and it is presented in Section 1.2. "],
["sa-censoring.html", "1.2 Censoring", " 1.2 Censoring Censoring is a mechanisms that causes survival times to be unobserved. There are many reasons why censoring may occur; among others: a person does not experience the event before the end of the study; a person drops out of the study before the occurrence of the event of interest; a person experience a competing event that impedes the occurrence of the event of interest (e.g.: death, when death is not the study outcome). Figure 1.1: Simulated right censored survival data, plotted by their calendar time in panel A and by their study time in panel B. I simulated survival data for illustration purposes: I assumed a clinical trial with 10 individuals enrolled during a recruitment window of 1 year, and followed for up to 5 years. Not all individuals experience the event of interest during the study period, and are therefore censored after five years from the start of the study. The observation time for each individual is depicted in Figure 1.1 with a solid dark grey line, a cross represents the occurrence of the study event, and a circle represents censoring. Individuals A, E, and J all have censored survival time: I know that they were still event-free at the end of follow-up, i.e. their real survival time is greater than the observed one, but the former is unknown. The simulated data is presented in Figure 1.1: in panel A, survival data is plotted against the calendar time; conversely, in panel B, survival data is plotted against the study time, e.g. each individual is assigned a time zero corresponding to their enrollment in the study, and survival time is counted from there. This example represents a particular form of censoring: right censoring. The defining characteristic of right-censored data is that it is censored (or incomplete) at the right side of the follow-up time, hence the true survival time is greater than the observed time. This example represents administrative censoring as well, as individuals are censored at the end of the study to artificially restrict follow-up time (e.g. for financial reasons). It is also possible to encounter data that is left censored or interval censored. In the former case, the true survival time is shorter that the observed one, e.g. I know that the event occurred before the observation time, but I do not know when - imagine onset of a viral infection, which can be detected only at a visit time. In the latter, I know that the event occurred within a certain interval of time but I do not know when; using the same example of infection onset, if infection was detected at a visit date but the individual was known to be infection-free at the previous visit, the true infection onset time is unknown and the event time is said to be interval censored. Finally, another important concept related to right censoring is that of left truncation (or delayed entry). Left truncation occurs when an individual enrolls in the study some time after the inclusion criteria are satisfied; individuals that die (or emigrate, …) before the start of observation time will never enter the study, and inclusion time may differ between individuals. Data arising from such phenomenon is therefore said to be left truncated. "],
["sa-terminology-notation.html", "1.3 Terminology and notation", " 1.3 Terminology and notation I denote the random variable for an individual’s survival time with \\(S\\); since it denotes time, \\(S\\) can assume any non-negative value. The lower-case \\(s\\) represent a specific value of interest drawn from \\(S\\) for a given individual. In the case of right censoring, I denote with \\(C\\) the random variable representing censoring time, and \\(c\\) its realisation. The observed time is denoted with \\(T = \\min(S, C)\\), and its realisation is \\(t\\). Finally, I denote with \\(D = I(S \\le C)\\) the random variable indicating either occurrence of the event of interest or censorship; analogously as before, its realisation is lower-case \\(d\\). Next, I defined two quantities of interest in survival analysis, the survival function and the hazard function. They are both functions of the observed time \\(t\\) and are denoted by \\(S(t)\\) and \\(h(t)\\), respectively. The survival function is the complement of the cumulative distribution function of the observed time \\(T\\) and represent the probability that a given individual survives1 longer than a specified time \\(t\\): \\[ S(t) = 1 - F_T(t) = 1 - P(T \\le t) = P(T &gt; t) \\] \\(t\\) ranges (theoretically) between 0 and infinity, hence the survival function can be plotted as a smooth, continuous function that tends to 0 as \\(t\\) goes to infinity. In practice, though, the survival function appears as a step function as (1) individuals can be observed at discrete times only and (2) not all individuals may experience the event before the end of the study. Figure 1.2 depicts this difference: in panel A I plotted a theoretical survival function, restricted to 15 years of follow-up for comparison purposes, while in panel B I plotted the survival function relative to the survival data simulated in Section 1.2. The former is a smooth function of time, and should we extend the x-axis to infinity the function would eventually reach zero. Conversely, the latter is a step function with steps at each event time, and should we extend the x-axis to infinity the function would remain flat after the last observed event. Figure 1.2: Theoretical survival function (A) and observed survival function for simulated data (B). The hazard function \\(h(t)\\) is the limit of the probability of the survival time \\(T\\) laying within an interval \\([t, t + \\Delta(t))\\) given that an individual survived up to time \\(t\\) divided by the length of the interval \\(\\Delta(t)\\), for \\(\\Delta(t)\\) approaching zero: \\[ h(t) = \\lim_{\\Delta(t) \\to 0} \\frac{P(t \\le T &lt; t + \\Delta(t) | T \\ge t)}{\\Delta(t)} \\] It represent the instantaneous potential (e.g. risk) for the event to occur within the interval \\([t, t + \\Delta(t))\\) (with \\(\\Delta(t) \\to 0\\)), given that the individual survived up to time \\(t\\). The hazard function is always non-negative, it can assume different shapes over time, and it has no upper bound. In Figure 1.3 I present a simple hazard function; it increases over time, which means that the instantaneous risk of event increases over time. Figure 1.3: Example of hazard function. The survival function from Figure 1.2, panel A, and the hazard function from Figure 1.3 are strictly related. In fact, there is a clearly defined mathematical relationship between the survival and the hazard function: it is possible to derive the form of \\(S(t)\\) when knowing the form of \\(h(t)\\), and vice versa. Formally: \\[ S(t) = \\exp \\left[ -\\int_0^t h(u) \\ du \\right] \\] \\[ h(t) = -\\left[ \\frac{d S(t) / dt}{S(t)} \\right] \\] Finally, a third quantity of interest in survival analysis that is strictly related to the survival and hazard functions is the cumulative hazard function \\(H(t)\\). The cumulative hazard function represents the accumulation of hazard (e.g. \\(h(t)\\)) over time, and can be defined as \\[ H(t) = \\int_0^t h(u) \\ du; \\] it can conveniently be expressed in terms of survival function via the relationship \\(H(t) = - \\log S(t)\\), or alternatively with \\(S(t) = \\exp(-H(t))\\). I use the term survives loosely speaking, for conciseness - formally, I refer to not experiencing the event of interest.↩ "],
["sa-estsurv.html", "1.4 Estimation of the survival function", " 1.4 Estimation of the survival function The survival function presented in Figure 1.2, panel B, is a non-parametric estimate of the true survival function based on the data only. The estimator employed is this case is the Kaplan-Meier estimator of the survival function (Kaplan and Meier 1958), with which the estimated survival probabilities are obtained using a product limit formula. The general form for the Kaplan-Meier estimator at time \\(t_{(i)}\\) is \\[ \\hat{S}(t_{(i)}) = \\hat{S}(t_{(i - 1)}) \\times \\hat{P}(T &gt; t_{(i)} | T \\ge t_{(i)}), \\] with \\(t_{(i)}\\) being the \\(i\\)th ordered failure time. The interpretation is straightforward: it is the product of the probability of surviving past the previous event-time (\\(\\hat{S}(t_{(i - 1)})\\)) times the conditional probability of surviving past the current time \\(t_{(i)}\\) given survival to at least the current time (\\(\\hat{P}(T &gt; t_{(i)} | T \\ge t_{(i)})\\)). The product limit formula is: \\[ \\hat{S}(t_{(i)}) = \\prod_{j = 1}^i \\hat{P}(T &gt; t_{(j)} | T \\ge t_{(j)}) \\] The conditional probability in the product limit formula can be estimated from the observed data as: \\[ \\hat{P}(T &gt; t_{(i)} | T \\ge t_{(i)}) = \\frac{r_{(i)} - e_{(i)}}{r_{(i)}}, \\] where \\(r_{(i)}\\) and \\(e_{(i)}\\) are the number of individuals at risk and the number of events at time \\(t_{(i)}\\), respectively. The Kaplan-Meier estimator can be computed using R and the function survfit from the survival package. An example using the simulated data from Section 1.2 (stored in a data frame named data): # library(survival) fit = survfit(Surv(time = t0, event = d) ~ 1, data = data) summary(fit) ## Call: survfit(formula = Surv(time = t0, event = d) ~ 1, data = data) ## ## time n.risk n.event survival std.err lower 95% CI upper 95% CI ## 0.687 10 1 0.9 0.0949 0.7320 1.000 ## 0.975 9 1 0.8 0.1265 0.5868 1.000 ## 1.047 8 1 0.7 0.1449 0.4665 1.000 ## 2.580 7 1 0.6 0.1549 0.3617 0.995 ## 2.780 6 1 0.5 0.1581 0.2690 0.929 ## 3.143 5 1 0.4 0.1549 0.1872 0.855 ## 4.606 2 1 0.2 0.1612 0.0412 0.971 By doing so, I obtain an estimate of the survival function (column survival) at each distinct failure time (column time). For instance, the survival probability at \\(t\\) = 1.047 is 0.700, with 95% confidence interval (0.467 - 1.000). Finally, plotting the estimated survival curve I obtain Figure 1.4, which is exactly the same survival curve presented in panel B of Figure 1.2. # library(ggfortify) autoplot(fit, conf.int = FALSE, censor = FALSE) + theme_bw() + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1)) + labs(x = &quot;Time&quot;, y = expression(hat(S)[KM](t))) Figure 1.4: Estimated survival function using the Kaplan-Meier estimator on the simulated data.

["training-and-courses.html", "10.2 Training and courses", " 10.2 Training and courses I have attended a wide variety of courses during my first year, both externally and internally to the University of Leicester. The external courses I attended are: Efficient R Programming, on November 8th 2016, organised by the Royal Statistical Society in London. The instructor was Dr. Colin Gillespie, from the University of Newcastle, United Kingdom, and Jumping Rivers. The course covered how to program efficiently with R; in particular, it covered common pitfalls when writing R code, code profiling, RCpp, and parallel programming. General hints and tips were provided. Introduction to causal inference, on April 25th and 26th 2017, organised by the Biostatistics Research Group at the University of Leicester and delivered by Dr. Arvid Sjölander from Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. The course provided foundational concepts of causal inference such as the difference between association and causation, the counterfactual framework, exchangeability, directed acyclic graphs, methods for estimating a causal effect, etc. Additionally, it provided an introduction to more advanced methods such as intrumental variables and Mendelian randomisation. Using simulation studies to evaluate statistical methods, on May 22nd 2017, organised by University College London. The course was delivered by Dr. Tim Morris, Prof. Ian White and Dr. Michael Crowther, and it covered the rationale for using simulation studies, important concepts to keep in mind when planning a simulation study, computational tools, estimates of uncertainty, and tools for improving reporting and dissemination. Workshop on Joint modelling of longitudinal and time-to-event data with R, on July 5th, 2017, organised by the Department of Biostatistics of the University of Liverpool. The course was delivered by Dr. Graeme Hickey, and provided an introduction to joint models of longitudinal and survival data, including extensions to incorporate competing risks and multiple longitudinal processes and a practical session using R. I have attended a few courses within the University and not offered on PROSE; specifically, I attended a course on Time series analysis with R (November 10th, 2016), a course on Data visualisation (November 15th, 2016), and a course on High performance computing at Leicester (February 8th, 2017). The latter was particularly important, as it allowed me to make better use of the high-performance computing facilities offered by the University. I also attended the Preparing to teach in higher education workshop, strand A (July 24th and 27th 2017). Additionally, I have attended the following PROSE training sessions to develop personal and communication skills in research settings. These are listed below: Planning your literature search, October 21st 2016; Conducting your literature search, October 25th 2016 ; Assertiveness, November 14th 2016; Introduction to critical thinking, December 15th 2016; Presentations A: Fundamentals of an effective presentation, January 30th 2017; Communication in research and other work settings, January 31st 2017; Enhancing your digital profile, February 2nd 2017; Saying it with your abstract, February 10th 2017; Designing a poster, February 27th 2017; Leadership in research and other work environments, February 28th 2017; Preparing for the probation review (Physical natural and medical sciences), May 30th 2017.
